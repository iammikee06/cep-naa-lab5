Easy Pinwheels Ingredients

Sour cream: We recommend a low-fat sour cream, though a regular sour cream is just fine too.
Cream cheese: The cream cheese needs to be softened for use in this recipe, so make sure to get it out of the fridge at least half an hour before you start the prep.
Green onions: The green onions should be finely sliced so their flavor blends into the dish, and so the texture is just right.
Cheddar cheese: Finely shredded cheddar cheese works best for this, so it blends into the filling.
Lime juice: Fresh lime juice is ideal, as it is packed with tangy flavor, but a bottled lime juice is fine.
Jalapeno pepper: Remove the seeds and any large ribs from the jalapenos before you mince them.
Flour tortillas: Flour tortillas are plain enough to let the other flavors shine.
Salsa or picante sauce: You can use mild or hot salsa, picante sauce or salsa verde; whatever sounds tasty.

Directions
Step 1: Make the filling and chill then roll up the tortillas. 
	Combine the sour cream, cream cheese, green onions, cheddar cheese, lime juice and jalape√±os in a bowl, then spread mixture on one side of each tortilla and roll each up tightly.

Step 2: Refrigerate and slice
	Cover and refrigerate them for at least one hour, then slice each into 1-inch pieces and serve with salsa or picante sauce.
